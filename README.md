# LoongArch Hardware Discovery

This is a repository where I put my LoongArch hardware reverse engineering stuff.

The code repo contains some utilities I developed for this purpose.

[Wiki](https://github.com/RigoLigoRLC/loongarch-hardware-discovery/wiki) contains articles and reverse engineered documentations.
